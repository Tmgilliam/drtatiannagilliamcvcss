              <h2>HelloüòÅ</h2>
              <p class="bio">I am a United States Navy and Army Veteran and software implementation and solutions design expert with 18 years of experience in education and business management as well as seven years of experience in ERP implementation research for SMEs in manufacturing. A unique and driven professional specializing in critical analysis, process planning, and agile project management. A 2022 field of study graduate of Walden University's Doctorate of Business Administration Program with a concentration in International Business; interested in CRM, Enterprise Resource Planning, Solutions Configuration, and Implementation of Enterprise Software.
                             My initial introduction to ERP and SaaS software began at the University of Scranton's ERP/SAP certification program. I gained a broader understanding of SAP software and its uses in materials management within an enterprise environment and I am an expert in cultivating positive and productive relationships with diverse stakeholders. I excel in lean-agile project management, emphasizing workflows and process optimization. My communicative project management approach revolves around a strong proficiency in the latest hardware and software technologies, and I have proven to be exemplary in project management roles involved in development and troubleshooting organizational projects and programs.

                             I enjoy maintaining cooperative working relationships with supervisors and peers. My well-developed knowledge in analytical and problem-solving capabilities shine within ERP Implementation projects. Furthermore, I have a strong background in customer service with a proven history of resolving conflicts effectively. </p>
